## 🧠 Machine Learning: Regression & Classification Comprehensive Guide

This guide provides a structured look at comparing regression models, evaluating classification performance, and understanding the trade-offs in model fitting.

## 1. Regression Model Comparison

In real-world implementation, we run multiple algorithms on the same dataset to compare performance based on specific hyperparameters.

### Model Ranking Table (Example: Employee Database)

| Model | Configuration | Score/Error |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **KNN Regressor** | neighbors = 4 | 190.0 |
| **Polynomial Regression** | degree = 5 | 174.8 |
| **SVR** | kernel = 'poly', degree = 5 | 164.0 |
| **Random Forest (RFR)** | default | 158.0 |
| **Decision Tree (DTR)** | default | 150.0 |

## 2. Classification Fundamentals

### The Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix is calculated by comparing **Actual Data ()** against **Predicted Data ()**. This is the primary tool for visualizing the performance of a classifier.

|  | Predicted: YES | Predicted: NO |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Actual: YES** | **TP** (True Positive) | **FN** (False Negative) |
| **Actual: NO** | **FP** (False Positive) | **TN** (True Negative) |

### Performance Metrics

* **Accuracy:** 
* **Error Rate:** 
* *Type 1 Error:* False Positive (FP) — Predicting an event when it didn't happen.
* *Type 2 Error:* False Negative (FN) — Missing an event that did happen.


* **Precision:** 
* **Recall:** 
* **F1 Score:**

## 3. Fit Analysis (Bias vs. Variance)

| Metric | Underfitting | Overfitting | Best Fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cause** | Too few attributes | Too many attributes | Relevant attributes |
| **Bias (Train)** | High | Low | Low |
| **Variance (Test)** | Low | High | Low |
| **Solution** | Add relevant features | PCA, Regularization, Dropout | Cross-Validation |

## 4. Algorithm Roadmap

### Classification Algorithms

* **Logistic Regression:** Uses the **Sigmoid Activation Function** to map probabilities into a binary outcome.
* **KNN Classifier:** Instance-based learning that classifies based on the "k" nearest data points.
* **SVM Classifier:** Uses hyperplanes to maximize the margin between classes.
* **Naive Bayes:** A fast, probability-based algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem.

### Tree-Based & Ensemble Learning

* **Decision Tree:** Uses a flowchart-like structure to make decisions based on feature values.
* **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models to improve performance.
* **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):** e.g., **Random Forest**, which builds multiple trees independently and averages them.
* **Boosting:** e.g., **XGBoost**, **LightGBM (LGBM)**, which builds trees sequentially to correct the errors of previous trees.

## 5. Implementation Insights

* **Probability Concept:** Two main algorithms follow core probability principles: **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**.
* **The Sigmoid Curve:** In Logistic Regression, the Sigmoid function maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1:

This allows the model to output a probability that can be converted into a binary classification (e.g., if , predict YES).
