logistic logit or maxent classifier 
		how to predict validation data 
		validation data vs live data 
		3 phase model testing will perform 
		mean of it 
		bunch of classification model 
		best accuracy model & best model testing & best avg score 
		pickle

=== KNN ALGORITHM ( k nearest neighbour) 
		
1- distance matrix 
		Euclidian distance  
		manhatten distance 
		
knn -- how th3 distance matrxix & nearest help to classify the data 

knn classificaion -- based on k point we classify the new datapoint 
knn regression -- based on k point we take mean of nearest neighbours 


does outlier is impact to knn model -- yes | no  --- (yes ) 
does outlier is impact to logistic regression -- (no)  cuz of sigmoid curve adjsute outlier 


when i apply these 2 algo to 1 dataset ( accuracy will change) 
when ever multi model 1 datraset 

overfitting == techniqe 

logistic -- sigmoied categr, sovler - 
knn -- distance, ed, md outleri will impaact 


same dataset 
knn - 95%    
logistic -- 92.50%  
svm --
