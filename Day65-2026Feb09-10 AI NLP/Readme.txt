AI & NLP Fundamentals – Code Concept Summary

This repository explains core Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing concepts using simple Python-based logic and examples.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI refers to building machines that can simulate human intelligence such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making.

## Traditional Programming
In traditional programming, humans define fixed rules that produce outputs for given inputs.

## Machine Learning (ML)
Machine learning allows systems to automatically learn rules and patterns directly from data instead of manual programming.

## Data, Model, and Prediction
Data is used to train a model, and the trained model is used to make predictions on new inputs.

## NLP (Natural Language Processing)
NLP enables machines to process, analyze, and work with human language in text or speech form.

## Corpus
A corpus is a large structured collection of text data used for training and testing NLP models. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Tokenization (Word Tokenization)
Word tokenization splits a sentence into individual words or tokens.

## Sentence Tokenization
Sentence tokenization divides a paragraph into individual sentences.

## Token Length
Token length is used to measure how many words or units exist in a given text.

## Blank Line Tokenization
Blank line tokenization separates text into paragraphs based on empty lines.

## N-grams
N-grams represent sequences of words used to capture context in language (uni-gram, bi-gram, tri-gram, etc.).

## Stemming
Stemming reduces words to their root form by removing suffixes like *ing*, *ed*, or *s*.

## Porter Stemmer
Porter Stemmer is a common stemming algorithm that aggressively trims words to their base form.

## Lancaster Stemmer
Lancaster Stemmer is a more aggressive stemmer that produces shorter root words.

## Snowball Stemmer
Snowball Stemmer is an improved and language-specific version of the Porter Stemmer.

## Lemmatization
Lemmatization converts words into their dictionary base form while preserving meaning.

## WordNet Lemmatizer
WordNet Lemmatizer uses vocabulary and grammar rules to return meaningful root words.

## Stopwords
Stopwords are common words like *is*, *the*, *and* that are removed to reduce noise in text analysis.

## Regular Expressions (Regex)
Regex is used to clean text by removing punctuation, numbers, or unwanted characters.

## Part of Speech (POS) Tagging
POS tagging identifies grammatical roles such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb in a sentence.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)
NER detects and classifies entities like names, locations, organizations, and dates in text.

## Chunking
Chunking groups related words into meaningful phrases such as noun phrases.

## Word Cloud
A word cloud visually represents frequently occurring words in a text dataset.

## NLP to NLU Transition
NLP processes text technically, while NLU focuses on understanding meaning and intent.

## Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
NLU enables machines to understand intent, context, and meaning from user input.

## Natural Language Generation (NLG)
NLG enables machines to generate human-like sentences as responses.

## Complete AI Language Flow
User input is processed by NLP, understood by NLU, and responded to using NLG.

## Learning Outcome
This repository builds a strong foundation in AI, NLP, NLU, and NLG concepts with practical code logic.
